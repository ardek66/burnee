* Burnee
Burnee is a simple web application that returns HTTP responses from Gemtext files.

It generates not only valid but correct HTML, in order to make sure the content is
rendered properly in most browsers.

The server runs in the background and for every request it responds with the file specified in the GET
path inside the root directory converted to HTML. Mostly meant for http reverse proxies such as nginx.
